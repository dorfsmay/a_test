# HTML

HTML describes what each piece of text is (semantic).  
HTML semantic allows:

* browser to render properly, know what elements to apply style to
* computers to understand the information. eg: search engine
* accessibility (in browser and non-browser). eg: screenreaders

---
# HTML is sufficient

Browsers have defaults: they can render properly without CSS and JavaScript.  
Starting with HTML only works and easy to learn.

# HTML Element

### Regular element
Opening Tag - content - Closing tag

* `<h6>`: lowest level header
* `<p>`: paragraph
* `<strong>`: strong text, bold
* `<a href=>`: Anchor for links
